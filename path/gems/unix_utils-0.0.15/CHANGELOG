0.0.15 / 2012-11-09

* Enhancements

  * Back to stdlib open3 because C extension support is not enabled by default in JRuby 1.7+

* Known issues

  * stderr is not captured in JRuby 1.7.0 because of https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-6986

0.0.14 / 2012-07-06

* Breaking changes

  * UnixUtils.du_sk -> UnixUtils.du (but it's still `du -sk`)
  * Heuristic for detecting attempts to curl a local file changed - now it looks for absence of '://'

0.0.13 / 2012-05-16

* Bug fixes

  * `which -s` didn't work on all platforms

0.0.12 / 2012-05-09

* Bug fixes

  * Unreleased code (dos2unix and unix2dos) appeared in gem release - got rid of that.

0.0.11 / 2012-05-07

* Bug fixes

  * Fix handling of local files by UnixUtils.curl

0.0.10 / 2012-04-23

* Breaking changes

  * Added UnixUtils.du_sk, which always returns bytes; removed UnixUtils.du, which returned block counts, which I doubt you wanted.

* Enhancements

  * If you call a method with _s at the end, you get a string back. For example: UnixUtils.head_s
  * UnixUtils.tmp_path no longer junks up tmp paths with lots of "unix_utils_RANDOMSTRING"

0.0.9 / 2012-04-12

* Bug fixes

  * Correct implementation of :read_from

0.0.8 / 2012-04-12

* Bug fixes

  * Let perl handle its own input files (ARGF)... my implementation using IO.select was not working.

0.0.7 / 2012-04-11

* Bug fixes

  * Make sure UnixUtils.tmp_path doesn't create too-long filenames

0.0.6 / 2012-04-11

* Enhancements

  * iconv command silently discards invalid characters

0.0.5 / 2012-03-21

* Enhancements

  * Change pipe buffer size to 64kb (it was 4mb before), which seems to make everything run faster

* Bug fixes

  * Thanks to @leomao10, make sed work more reliably on large files by using its input-file argument rather than piping in data

0.0.4 / 2012-03-19

* Bug fixes

  * NoMethodError when trying to print $stderr - thanks @leomao10 !

0.0.3 / 2012-03-19

* Enhancements

  * Uses https://github.com/rtomayko/posix-spawn to make things faster - suggested by @jjb in https://github.com/seamusabshere/unix_utils/issues/1
  * Depends less on chdir to work properly - expands file paths immediately

* Bug fixes

  * Correctly use pipes (I hope) - imitate POSIX::Spawn::Child's use of IO.select

0.0.2 / 2012-02-16

* Bug fixes

  * Fix use of splat internally so that it actually runs in MRI 1.8.7 and JRuby

0.0.1 / 2012-02-16 (yanked!)

* Birthday!
